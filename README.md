# hBN Experiments

This experiments are part of the [COMPHORT - QUANTERA](https://www.antonsolanaslab.com/research/projects) <!-- Insertar link de la pagina de comphort (no la encontre de momento) --> initiative.

# 📚 Content
This folder contained all the measurement and data analysis tools used during these experiments. Below there is a brief explanation for each folder, each file starts with a description of their use.

## 🖥️ Basic Device Controls

This folder has all the libraries and codes to acces the different machineries of the lab. It includes the showed ones but also others hidden, that can be found in other repositories like [Attocube](), [Qutag]() or [Lightfield](). However some examples on how to operate the hidden and not hidden devices can also be found.

## 📈 Data Analysis and Visualization

This folder includes the tools used to analize the data that were measured using the instruments previously mentioned. Visualizing data and fitting into typical quantum optics functions like g2, lifetime exponentials or saturation curves are some of the main characters inside this folder.

## ⚙️ Measure Automation

The codes included in this folder are devoted to perform automatic measurements that usually involve the use of several devices like the spectrometer, laser, power meter... Some of these codes also include features that enable the previsualization of the collected data.

## 🕶️ Pasabanda Tuneable

This is a program build and coded by Alejandro Izquierdo Molina during his bachelor thesis. It allows the rotational control of two bandpass filters, letting us choose the desire center wavelength and width of the transmitted light.
